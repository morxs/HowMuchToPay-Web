HowMuchToPay-Web
================
How Much To Pay is an Web App to calculate total amount to pay for investment needed 
including fee. Example: You want to invest $1000 to your investment institution, however, 
the institution is getting fee based on your investment, let say 1.1% of it. Of course, 
if you just pay $1000, minusing 1.1% of fee, your final investment will be lower than $1000 
already. This app is used to calculate final investment amount plus the fee, so you invest 
what amount you want to invest.
